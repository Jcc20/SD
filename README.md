# File Exchange

In this project, we were asked to implement a platform to share music files, similar to how Soundcloud works, as a client/server system in **JAVA**,
making use of sockets and threads to implement multithreading, while preventing race conditions through locks and conditions.

The assignment was developed in **Distributed Systems**, in the last semester of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
